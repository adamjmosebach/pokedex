# Project Overview

## Project Name

Pokedex

## Project Description

This project will create a Pokedex - which is a sort of encyclopedia of different pokemon. The user will be able to select a pokemon based on their number or name.  Then the app will display the various information on the selected pokemon, including their number, type, and other attributes.  It will also have another area where the user can see more information, such as what types said-pokemon would be good against and weak against in battle.

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 

- User enters Name or Number of pokemon
- App displays relevant pokemon-specific attributes on the screen
- User can then click one of two buttons on the side to find out more information about which types the pokemon selected would be good and bad against in battle

#### PostMVP

- Having rendered information appear in a pokemon card-like format
- Good/Weak dropdown animation
- Pokedex cover image when page first loads
- Music when page first loads (then stops when you enter site)
- A personality test to deterine which pokemon you are most like (this is a reach goal)
